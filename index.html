            <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
            <p>As students, we are keenly interested in exploring the ongoing service challenges facing the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), which serves as a vital link in Boston's public transportation system. 
                The MBTA plays a crucial role, serving thousands of commuters each day. However, persistent issues such as delays, slow zones, and inconsistent ridership patterns have led to frustration and decreased satisfaction among passengers. 
                Understanding the root causes of these problems is essential for improving the system's reliability and efficiency. In this project, we aim to analyze data on ridership trends, transit disruptions, 
                speed restrictions, and the frequency of active speed restriction days to uncover patterns that contribute to service interruptions. Through graphical visualizations, we hope to answer the question:
                How is the MBTA so slow? By identifying key areas of the system that require attention—whether related to infrastructure, scheduling, or operational factors—we aim to provide valuable insights. 
                Our findings will help policymakers, transit planners, and riders, supporting efforts to improve the MBTA’s reliability and overall effectiveness for the benefit of Boston's commuting community.</p>

            <h2>Findings & Summary</h2>
            <p>Our analysis revealed that the Green Line experiences the most speed restrictions and operates at the slowest pace compared to other MBTA lines. Additionally, it has the most turbulent ridership patterns, 
                likely due to these persistent delays and operational challenges. Notably, these speed restrictions are active on average for longer periods than on any other line, exacerbating delays and inefficiencies. 
                This was our primary takeaway from the visualizations we created, but a more comprehensive analysis could uncover deeper insights, such as identifying specific causes for these restrictions or patterns in ridership behavior. 
                These findings could assist the MBTA in pinpointing critical areas for improvement—ranging from addressing speed restrictions to optimizing service reliability. Ultimately, implementing these changes could enhance the overall 
                rider experience and boost public transit usage in Boston.</p>
